# About me

- I'm unsure what sector specifically I will end up working in but be it tech, physics or finance there is very likely to be some coding involved.
- After I have done A levels in Computer Science, Physics and Double Maths, I will do a degree in Physics (hopefully at Oxford).
- I have already achieved a 9 in GCSE Computer Sceince. 
- I’m currently working on a chess engine. It is an AI based engine that will user a minimax algorithm to try to determine the best move in any given chess position.
- I’m currently learning A level Compueter Science. 
- How to reach me: my email is lsb@nmpbooks.com
- This is a group project I collaberated on in class about a simple Hotel system. - https://github.com/BHASVIC-CompSci/LouisBuckland-Jack-HotelKashyyyk
- This is another group project I worked on in class which developed my knowledge of Java greatly. We had to code a version of monopoly with animals, therefore it was called animonopoly. - https://github.com/BHASVIC-CompSci/animalopoly-BHASVIC-LouisBuckland24. This link is only to the parts that I coded so are not able to be run but do show my ability.
